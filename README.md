# RGP4
It is the code of RGP.

## Installation instructions

Set up StarCraft II and SMAC:
```shell
bash install_sc2.sh
```
This will download SC2 into the 3rdparty folder and copy the maps necessary to run over.

The requirements.txt file can be used to install the necessary packages into a virtual environment (not recomended).

## Run an experiment 

```shell
python src/main.py --config=had_qmix_mlp --env-config=sc2
```

The config files act as defaults for an algorithm or environment. 

They are all located in `src/config`.
`--config` refers to the config files in `src/config/algs`
`--env-config` refers to the config files in `src/config/envs`

All results will be stored in the `Results` folder.

## Saving and loading learnt models

### Saving models

You can save the learnt models to disk by setting `save_model = True`, which is set to `False` by default. The frequency of saving models can be adjusted using `save_model_interval` configuration. Models will be saved in the result directory, under the folder called *models*. The directory corresponding each run will contain models saved throughout the experiment, each within a folder corresponding to the number of timesteps passed since starting the learning process.

### Loading models

Learnt models can be loaded using the `checkpoint_path` parameter, after which the learning will proceed from the corresponding timestep.
